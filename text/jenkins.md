# Jenkins Ryan KT

Jenkins 1 (QA):
  url: https://jenkins1.bris.cdi.com/jenkins/

There are two kinds of tests that get executed
  1.) UI - Selenium
  2.) Web Services - Soap UI

Selenium:
  The grid runs at: 10.20.1.22

Start the selenium process with the follow command:
su -c "find /home/relmanager/10.20.1.22/tools/selenium -name 'launchhub.sh' -exec sh -c 'nohup {} &' \;" -s /bin/bash relmanager

These processes have been set to start at bootup via /etc/rc.local

The selenium grid/SoapUI nodes are windows machines:
  10.20.1.{27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37}

  and can be accessed via RDP and wrelmanager/10FwQhCWF1o

  To start the selenium process and connect the node to the grid, execute the .bat file in C:\Node

There is a scheduled task on 10.20.1.37 that run at 6am everyday to convert testng reports into the jelly bean reports. This executes a java program that is owned by the QA team

the Jelly bean reports can be accessed at:
  http://10.20.1.37:8080/ReportGenerate/


Jenkins 2 (ITE):
  Maven settings.xml file:
    File is located at: /opt/maven/conf/settings.xml. It is rare that this will ever need updated, but if you need to point to a new artifact repository, it will be done here.

  Versioning:
    Versions are derived from the timestamp of the most recent commit for the job in question. The jenkins job will determine the version with the following
    command: VERSION=$(git show -s --format=%at). This will derive a unix timestamp version like 1446041589 and the rpm spec file will use this version when building the rpm

Jenkins 3 (STE):
  Versioning:
    Versions are derived from the tag being built. So, if the Jenkins job is building tag 3.18.1, the rpm versioning will be 3.18.1.

  Release tasks:
    1. execute create branch job (http://jenkins3.bris.cdi.com/jenkins/view/RELEASE-BRANCH/job/create-branch/) on all repos being released. from_branch will typically be master and branch_name should be of the form release-<version> (release-3.18)
    2. execute the bump-pom-and-tag jobs to update POM files and create a git tag for all repos. from_branch should be the name of the branch created in step 1. tag_version should be an incrementing tag version, like 3.18.1
    3. repeat step 2, bumping the minor version, for all subsequent hotfix releases.

  The branching and release strategy is documented in detail: https://github.cdinteractive.com/devops/branch-release-strategy

Jenkins issues:
  The most common issue that arises is maven caching old versions of artifacts. When this happens, a developer will reach out and tell you that an old artifact is being cached. To fix this, login to jenkin2 and navigate to /backup/10.20.1.19/.m2 maven caching directory.
  you can then delete the directory for the artifact in question. So, if the issue is occurring on com.twinspires.cam, deleting the /backup/10.20.1.19/.m2/com/twinspires/cam directory and rebuilding will cause jenkins to generate a new, uncached artifact.

  It's rare, but sometimes a jenkins job will get into a weird state. Typically, clearing out the jobs workspace will fix the issue. So, if job GIT-TWS-RPM-TUX-BUILD is having trouble, login to jenkins2 and delete the directory: /backup/10.20.1.21/jenkins/jenkins_home/workspace/GIT-TWS-RPM-TUX-BUILD and rerun the build.

  The other common task is giving users permissions to the jenkins instance. the following page can be used to add them: https://jenkins2.bris.cdi.com/jenkins/role-strategy/assign-roles. Enter the users AD account like (john.smith) in the 	User/group to add field and then click the Add button
